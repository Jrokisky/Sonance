Overview:
Sonance is a way to experience music; a two dimensional game built around sound. The song that is selected is translated into a visual experience unlike traditional games. The game itself is minimalistic, focused on acquiring a high score. This simple premise, combined with the appealing visuals and a few twists provides for some interesting gameplay.  Included with the final game are two sample tracks that set the theme of the game, in addition the player is able to use their own music.


Instructions:
-Use W, A, S, and D controls to move and absorb the orbs around you.
